## Project Summary

The goal of this project is to create a working power supply with an isolated output with multiple voltage rails. This project took around 2 months worth of work to do with my teammate.

The final product passes the EN6100 Class A Harmonics qualifications, so it will be able to be plugged into any UK mains socket.
