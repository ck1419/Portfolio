[Home Page](index.md)

## Project Summary

This project resulted in a rover that could be controlled remotely via a website designed by the team.

The rover was able to detect and automatically avoid obstacles of various colors along its path to its intended destination. The rover also sends any information it has collected from its surroundings back to the server to be processed for better movement optimization.
