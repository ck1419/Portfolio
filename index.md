## About Me

I’m a fourth-year student from Thailand studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Imperial College for a master’s degree. I will be graduating in 2023.

I have an interest in the energy market, along with EVs. I am also interested in programming and have chosen programming modules when possible, along with some experimentation on my own outside of my courses.
