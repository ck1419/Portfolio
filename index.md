## About Me

I’m a third-year student from Thailand studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at imperial college for a master’s degree. 

I have an interest in the energy market, along with EVs. I plan on taking ‘energy system economics’ as an optional fourth year course to follow up on this interest. I am also interested in programming and have chosen programming modules when possible, along with some experimentation on my own outside of my courses.
