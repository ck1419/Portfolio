## Project Summary

This project attempts to formulate a high voltage direct current (HVDC) modular multilevel converter (MMC) as a power flow problem that can be solved numerically. This process includes making a model for a single-phase single-arm converter, which can then be scaled up into a single-phase two-arm converter and then the final three-phase six-arm converter.
