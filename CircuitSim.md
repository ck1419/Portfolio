# Basic Circuit Simulation Software

## Project Summary

This project was intended to mimic LTspice's basic capabilities with simulating simple circuit components (RLC) along with diodes in C++. The calculations are done using matrix calculations.

The simulator itself was designed to be fully compatible with LTspice's netlist, and the resulting values from a steady state simulation are the same.
